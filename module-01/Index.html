    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into Javascript programming and mapping.</p>

<h2>My reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p>The manifesto offers an alternative approach to examining and ruminating about maps, the map making process (e.g. cartography), and where and how all of this fits with 21st Century society and the fields of geography and cartography. The manifesto is indeed one of the more creative critiques.</p>

	<p>I find myself currently in the camp of cartographers and geographers. These disciplines are my passion and much and this sense of passion was galvanized during my graduate education in a geography department where I also took multiple cartography classes. However, I am now in the process of renewing and revising my career trajectory with the New Maps Program by learning about web technologies (e.g. Qgis, MapBox, CartoDB, Leaflet) as they apply to cartography and more broadly, geographic analysis. So moving forward I may be a bit more along the coder spectrum but will take the position of cartographic critique.</p> 

	<p>My priorities for my mapping career going forward are to learn new applications of web-based mapping and geospatial analysis. My current job as a civilian crime analyst simply does not allow the creativity, innovation, variety, and ability to conducting interesting and meaningful work. My hope and expectation is that through the New Maps Program I will learn and grow comfortable with open source mapping and the various forms of technology that enable this work. I am eager to revitalize my career in a direction that will provide meaning and passion to myself, but also make a positive and helpful contribution to some aspect of community and society. This eagerness reflects the nearly identical position in the Sheep Manifesto of "seeking to identify new ways of mapping that are productive of the kind of world we wish to live."</p>

	<p>I appreciated the dialectic tension and the sprinkling of punchy humor in examining the areas of cartography, coding, and critics of cartography in light of past and present. Some thoughtful questions were raised that are important to at least be considered by all who fall into any of the three main camps of thought.</p>
